## Hi, I'm Rhaine
I'm a full-stack web developer. I design and build clean, fast web apps with a strong UI/UX focus, then back them with the brand assets and campaigns they need to perform. My background spans 8+ years across design and marketing (EDMs, social ads, web banners/heroes) and, more recently, full-stack JavaScript.

## What Iâ€™m working on right now

- **Portfolio site refresh** â€” building a cleaner, faster version and tightening case studies for hiring managers.
- **Studio site** â€” a lightweight React build with **GSAP** micro-interactions and attention to performance.
- **Ongoing development** â€” improving accessibility and performance, strengthening analytics/SEO literacy, and refining **API design & integrations** (auth, data, third-party).

## Selected experience

### Dev Academy â€” Group projects (team-based, agile)
- **Role rotation:** moved from UI to the technical track so teammates could build UI skills; supported design to unblock the team.
- **What I owned:** REST API design, database schema & migrations (Knex), server routes/controllers (Node/Express), and live-data integrations.
- **Quality:** TDD with Vitest where practical; manual QA with Postman/Thunder Client; accessibility checks and cross-browser testing.
- **Outcome:** clear ownership on the backend, teammates grew UI confidence, and we delivered our MVPs as planned.
- **Stack:** React, TypeScript, Vite, Node/Express, PostgreSQL/SQLite, Knex, Auth (Auth0), Git/GitHub.
