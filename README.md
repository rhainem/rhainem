## Hi, I'm Rhaine
I design and build clean, fast web apps with a strong UI/UX focus, then back them with the brand assets and campaigns they need to perform. My background spans 8+ years across design and marketing (EDMs, social ads, web banners/heroes) and, more recently, full-stack JavaScript.

## What I’m working on right now

- **Portfolio site refresh** — building a cleaner, faster version and tightening case studies for hiring managers.
- **Studio site** — a lightweight React build with **GSAP** micro-interactions and attention to performance.
- **Ongoing development** — improving accessibility and performance, strengthening analytics/SEO literacy, and refining **API design & integrations** (auth, data, third-party).
